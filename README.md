# React Task App

Built as part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?) curriculum: [JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript) course.

In this React app a user can add tasks via a form and see all tasks previously added.
Tasks can also be deleted.

## Techniques Implemented

- Class-based components
- Type checking using TypeScript
- Passing props between components

## Improvement Idea

- Allow the user to edit a task already created
